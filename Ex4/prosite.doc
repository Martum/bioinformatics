* N-glycosylation site *
************************

It has been known for a long time [1] that potential N-glycosylation sites are
specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr.  It must be noted that the
presence of the consensus  tripeptide  is  not sufficient  to conclude that an
asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to  the fact that the  folding of  the
protein plays an important  role in the  regulation of N-glycosylation [2]. It
has been shown [3] that  the  presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr will
inhibit N-glycosylation; this  has  been confirmed by a recent [4] statistical
analysis of glycosylation sites, which also  shows that about 50% of the sites
that have a proline C-terminal to Ser/Thr are not glycosylated.

It must also  be noted that there  are  a few  reported cases of glycosylation
sites with the pattern Asn-Xaa-Cys; an  experimentally demonstrated occurrence
of such a non-standard site is found in the plasma protein C [5].

* cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site *
****************************************************************

There has been a  number of studies  relative to the  specificity of cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinases [1,2,3].  Both types of kinases appear to share
a preference  for  the  phosphorylation  of serine or threonine residues found
close to at least  two consecutive N-terminal  basic residues. It is important
to note that there are quite a number of exceptions to this rule.

In vivo, protein kinase C  exhibits  a  preference  for the phosphorylation of
serine or  threonine residues found close to a C-terminal basic residue [1,2].
The presence  of  additional   basic residues at the  N- or C-terminal of  the
target amino acid enhances the Vmax and Km of the phosphorylation reaction.

* Casein kinase II phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

Casein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is
independent of  cyclic  nucleotides   and  calcium.  CK-2  phosphorylates many
different proteins.   The  substrate  specificity [1]  of  this  enzyme can be
summarized as follows:

 (1) Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr.
 (2) An acidic residue (either Asp or Glu) must be present three residues from
     the C-terminal of the phosphate acceptor site.
 (3) Additional acidic  residues in  positions +1, +2, +4, and +5 increase the
     phosphorylation rate.  Most  physiological  substrates  have at least one
     acidic residue in these positions.
 (4) Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants.
 (5) A basic residue at the N-terminal  of the  acceptor  site  decreases  the
     phosphorylation rate, while an acidic one will increase it.

-Consensus pattern: [ST]-x(2)-[DE]
                    [S or T is the phosphorylation site]

-Note: This pattern is found in most of the known physiological substrates.

Substrates of tyrosine protein kinases are generally characterized by a lysine
or an arginine seven residues  to  the N-terminal side  of  the phosphorylated
tyrosine.  An acidic residue (Asp  or Glu) is often  found at either  three or
four residues to  the N-terminal side  of  the tyrosine  [1,2,3].  There are a
number of exceptions to  this rule such as the  tyrosine phosphorylation sites
of enolase and lipocortin II.

* N-myristoylation site *
*************************

An  appreciable  number of eukaryotic  proteins  are  acylated by the covalent
addition of myristate (a C14-saturated fatty acid) to their N-terminal residue
via an amide linkage [1,2]. The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible
for this  modification,   myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase (NMT),
has been  derived from the sequence of known N-myristoylated proteins and from
studies using synthetic peptides. It seems to be the following:

 - The N-terminal residue must be glycine.
 - In position 2, uncharged residues  are allowed.  Charged residues,  proline
   and large hydrophobic residues are not allowed.
 - In positions 3 and 4, most, if not all, residues are allowed.
 - In position  5,  small uncharged  residues are allowed (Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys,
   Asn and Gly). Serine is favored.
 - In position 6, proline is not allowed.

-Consensus pattern: G-{EDRKHPFYW}-x(2)-[STAGCN]-{P}
                    [G is the N-myristoylation site]

-Note: We  deliberately include as  potential myristoylated  glycine residues,
 those which  are  internal  to a sequence. It could well be that the sequence
 under study  represents  a  viral  polyprotein  precursor and that subsequent
 proteolytic processing  could expose an internal glycine as the N-terminal of
 a mature protein.

The precursor of  hormones  and other active  peptides  which are C-terminally

the amide group, and  most often by at  least two  consecutive  basic residues
(Arg or Lys) which generally function as an active peptide  precursor cleavage
site.  Although all amino acids can be amidated,  neutral hydrophobic residues
such as Val or Phe are good substrates, while  charged residues such as Asp or
Arg  are much less reactive.  C-terminal  amidation has not  yet been shown to
occur in unicellular organisms or in plants.

* Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (Gla) domain signature and profile *
**********************************************************************

The  vitamin  K-dependent  blood  coagulation  factor  IX  as  well as several
extracellular  regulatory proteins require vitamin K for the posttranslational
synthesis  of  gamma-carboxyglutamic  acid,  an  amino  acid  clustered in the
N-terminal  Gla  domain  of these proteins [1,2]. The Gla domain is a membrane
binding  motif  which,  in  the  presence  of  calcium  ions,  interacts  with
phospholipid membranes that include phosphatidylserine.

The  3D  structure  of  the  Gla  domain  has  been  solved  (see  for example
<PDB:1CFH>)  [3,4].  Calcium  ions  induce  conformational  changes in the Gla
domain  and  are  necessary  for  the  Gla  domain  to fold properly. A common
structural  feature  of functional Gla domains is the clustering of N-terminal
hydrophobic  residues  into a hydrophobic patch that mediates interaction with
the cell surface membrane [4].

Proteins known to contain a Gla domain are listed below:

 - A number of plasma proteins involved in blood coagulation.   These proteins
   are prothrombin, coagulation factors VII, IX and X, proteins C, S, and Z.
 - Two proteins that  occur  in calcified tissues:  osteocalcin (also known as
   bone-Gla protein, BGP), and matrix Gla-protein (MGP).
 - Proline-rich Gla proteins 1 and 2 [5].
 - Cone snail venom peptides: conantokin-G and -T, and conotoxin GS [6].

The  pattern  we  developed  start with the conserved Gla-x(3)-Gla-x-Cys motif
found  in  the  middle of the domain which seems to be important for substrate
recognition by the carboxylase [7] and end with the last conserved position of
the  domain (an aromatic residue). We also developed a profile that covers the
whole Gla domain.

* Phosphopantetheine attachment site *
**************************************

Phosphopantetheine (or pantetheine 4' phosphate) is  the  prosthetic  group of
acyl carrier proteins (ACP) in some  multienzyme complexes  where it serves as
a 'swinging  arm'  for  the  attachment of activated fatty acid and amino-acid
groups [1].  Phosphopantetheine  is  attached  to  a  serine  residue in these
proteins [2].  ACP  proteins  or   domains  have  been found in various enzyme
systems which  are  listed  below  (references  are only provided for recently
determined sequences).

 - Fatty  acid  synthase  (FAS),  which  catalyzes the formation of long-chain
   fatty acids  from  acetyl-CoA,  malonyl-CoA  and NADPH. Bacterial and plant
   chloroplast FAS are composed of eight separate subunits which correspond to
   the  different  enzymatic  activities;  ACP  is  one of these polypeptides.
   Fungal FAS consists of two multifunctional proteins, FAS1 and FAS2; the ACP
   domain is  located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of  FAS2.  Vertebrate FAS
   consists of a single  multifunctional  enzyme;  the ACP  domain  is located
   between the beta-ketoacyl reductase  domain and the C-terminal thioesterase
   domain [3].
 - Polyketide antibiotics  synthase enzyme systems.  Polyketides are secondary
   metabolites produced from simple fatty acids, by microorganisms and plants.
   ACP is one of the polypeptidic  components  involved in the biosynthesis of
   Streptomyces polyketide  antibiotics  actinorhodin,  curamycin, granatacin,
   monensin, oxytetracycline and tetracenomycin C.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  putative polyketide synthases pksK, pksL and pksM which
   respectively contain three, five and one ACP domains.
 - The multifunctional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from  Penicillium
   patulum. This is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a
   polyketide antibiotic  and  which  contains an ACP domain in the C-terminal
   extremity.
 - Multifunctional  mycocerosic  acid  synthase  (gene mas) from Mycobacterium
   bovis.
 - Gramicidin  S  synthase  I  (gene  grsA)  from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme
   catalyzes the  first  step  in  the  biosynthesis  of the cyclic antibiotic
   gramicidin S.
 - Tyrocidine  synthase  I  (gene  tycA)  from  Bacillus  brevis. The reaction
   carried out by tycA is identical to that catalyzed by grsA.
 - Gramicidin S synthase II (gene grsB) from Bacillus brevis. This enzyme is a
   multifunctional protein  that  activates  and  polymerizes proline, valine,
   ornithine and leucine. GrsB contains four ACP domains.
 - Erythronolide synthase proteins 1, 2 and 3 from Saccharopolyspora erythraea
   which is   involved  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  polyketide  antibiotic
   erythromicin. Each of these proteins contain two ACP domains.
 - Conidial green pigment synthase from Aspergillus nidulans.
 - ACV  synthase  from  various fungi. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in
   the biosynthesis  of  penicillin  and  cephalosporin. It contains three ACP
   domains.
 - Enterobactin  synthase  component F (gene entF) from Escherichia coli. This
   enzyme is  involved  in  the  ATP-dependent  activation  of  serine  during
   enterobactin (enterochelin) biosynthesis.
 - Cyclic  peptide  antibiotic  surfactin  synthase  subunits  1, 2 and 3 from
   Bacillus subtilis.  Subunits  1  and 2 contains three related domains while
   subunit 3 only contains a single domain.
 - HC-toxin  synthase  (gene  HTS1)  from  Cochliobolus  carbonum. This enzyme

* Prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site profile *
******************************************************************

In prokaryotes, membrane lipoproteins are synthesized  with a precursor signal
peptide, which is cleaved  by  a specific lipoprotein signal peptidase (signal
peptidase II). The peptidase recognizes a conserved sequence and cuts upstream
of a cysteine residue  to which a  glyceride-fatty acid lipid is attached [1].
Some of  the  proteins known to undergo such processing currently include (for
recent listings see [1,2,3]):

 - Major outer membrane lipoprotein (murein-lipoproteins) (gene lpp).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein-28 (gene nlpA).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein-34 (gene nlpB).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein nlpC.
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein nlpD.
 - Escherichia coli osmotically inducible lipoprotein B (gene osmB).
 - Escherichia coli osmotically inducible lipoprotein E (gene osmE).
 - Escherichia coli peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (gene pal).
 - Escherichia coli rare lipoproteins A and B (genes rplA and rplB).
 - Escherichia coli copper homeostasis protein cutF (or nlpE).
 - Escherichia coli plasmids traT proteins.
 - Escherichia coli Col plasmids lysis proteins.
 - A number of Bacillus beta-lactamases.
 - Bacillus subtilis periplasmic oligopeptide-binding protein (gene oppA).
 - Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface proteins A and B (genes ospA and ospB).

From  the precursor sequences of all these proteins, we derived a profile that
starts   at   the   beginning   of   the   sequence   and   ends   after   the

* Endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence *
********************************************

Proteins  that permanently reside in the  lumen  of  the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) seem to be distinguished from newly synthesized secretory proteins by the
presence of  the C-terminal  sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) [1,2]. While KDEL
is the preferred signal in many species, variants  of  that signal are used by
different species. This situation is described in the following table.

   Signal   Species
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   KDEL     Vertebrates, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants
   HDEL     Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, plants
   DDEL     Kluyveromyces lactis
   ADEL     Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast)
   SDEL     Plasmodium falciparum

The signal is usually very  strictly  conserved in  major ER proteins but some
minor ER  proteins  have   divergent  sequences  (probably  because  efficient
retention of these proteins is not crucial to the cell).

Proteins bearing the KDEL-type signal are  not simply held in the ER,  but are
selectively retrieved from a post-ER compartment by a receptor and returned to
their normal location.

The currently known ER luminal proteins are listed below.

 - Protein  disulfide-isomerase  (PDI)   (also  known  as  the beta-subunit of
   prolyl 4-hydroxylase, as  a  component  of  oligosaccharyl  transferase, as
   glutathione-insulin  transhydrogenase  and  as  a  thyroid  hormone binding
   protein).
 - ERp60, ERp72, and P5, three minor isoforms of PDI.
 - Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream-specific protein 2, a probable PDI.
 - hsp70  related  protein GRP78 (also known as the immunoglobulin heavy chain
   binding protein (BiP), and as KAR2, in fungi).
 - hsp90 related protein 'endoplasmin' (also known as GRP94, Erp99 or Hsp108).
 - Calreticulin, a  calcium-binding protein (also  known as calregulin, CRP55,
   or HACBP).
 - ERC-55, a calcium-binding protein.
 - Reticulocalbin, a calcium-binding protein.
 - Hsp47, a heat-shock protein that  binds  strongly to collagen and could act
   as a chaperone in the collagen biosynthetic pathway.
 - A receptor for a plant hormone, auxin.
 - Thiol proteases from rice bean (SH-EP) and kidney bean (EP-C1).
 - Esterases from mammalian liver and from nematodes.
 - Alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein (RAP).
 - Yeast peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase D (CYPD).
 - Yeast protein KRE5, a protein required for (1->6)-beta-D-glucan synthesis.
 - Yeast  protein  SEC20,  required    for  the transport of proteins from the
   endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
 - Yeast protein SCJ1, involved in protein sorting.

-Consensus pattern: [KRHQSA]-[DENQ]-E-L>
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for liver esterases which have H-[TVI]-E-L.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: 24 proteins which  are  clearly not
 located in  the  ER  (because  they  are  of  bacterial  or viral origin, for
 example) and a protein which can be considered as valid candidate: human 80K-
 H protein.

* Bipartite nuclear localization signal profile *
*************************************************

The uptake  of protein by  the   nucleus  is extremely selective   and nuclear
proteins must therefore  contain within  their final  structure a signal  that
specifies selective accumulation in the nucleus [1,2]. Studies on some nuclear
proteins, such as  the  large T antigen of SV40,  have indicated which part of
the sequence  is  required  for  nuclear  translocation.   The  known  nuclear
targeting sequences  are   generally  basic, but  there  seems to  be no clear
common denominator  between  all the known sequences.  Although some consensus
sequence patterns have  been proposed (see for example [3]),  the current best
strategy to detect a nuclear targeting sequence is based [4] on  the following
definition of what is called a 'bipartite nuclear localization signal':

  (1) Two adjacent basic amino acids (Arg or Lys).
  (2) A spacer region of any 10 residues.
  (3) At least three basic residues (Arg or Lys) in the five positions
      after the spacer region.

The  profile  we  developed  covers  the entire bipartite nuclear localization
signal.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: 56% of known
 nuclear proteins according to [4].
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: about 4.2% of  non-nuclear proteins
 according to [4].

-Note:  This profile replace an obsolete rule. All the information in the rule

*****************************************
* ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) *
*****************************************

From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
[1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that  bind ATP or GTP
share a number of more or less conserved sequence motifs.   The best conserved
of these  motifs  is  a  glycine-rich region, which typically forms a flexible
loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop interacts with one of
the phosphate  groups  of  the  nucleotide.   This sequence motif is generally
referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [1] or the 'P-loop' [5].

There are numerous ATP- or GTP-binding proteins  in which the P-loop is found.
We list below  a number of protein  families  for  which  the relevance of the
presence of such motif has been noted:

 - ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits (see <PDOC00137>).
 - Myosin heavy chains.
 - Kinesin heavy chains and kinesin-like proteins (see <PDOC00343>).
 - Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (see <PDOC00362>).
 - Guanylate kinase (see <PDOC00670>).
 - Thymidine kinase (see <PDOC00524>).
 - Thymidylate kinase (see <PDOC01034>).
 - Shikimate kinase (see <PDOC00868>).
 - Nitrogenase iron protein family (nifH/chlL) (see <PDOC00580>).
 - ATP-binding proteins involved  in 'active transport' (ABC transporters) [7]
   (see <PDOC00185>).
 - DNA and RNA helicases [8,9,10].
 - GTP-binding elongation factors (EF-Tu, EF-1alpha, EF-G, EF-2, etc.).
 - Ras family of GTP-binding proteins (Ras, Rho, Rab, Ral, Ypt1, SEC4, etc.).
 - Nuclear protein ran (see <PDOC00859>).
 - ADP-ribosylation factors family (see <PDOC00781>).
 - Bacterial dnaA protein (see <PDOC00771>).
 - Bacterial recA protein (see <PDOC00131>).
 - Bacterial recF protein (see <PDOC00539>).
 - Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins alpha subunits (Gi, Gs, Gt, G0, etc.).
 - DNA mismatch repair proteins mutS family (See <PDOC00388>).
 - Bacterial type II secretion system protein E (see <PDOC00567>).

Not all ATP- or GTP-binding proteins are picked-up by this motif.  A number of
proteins escape detection because the structure   of their ATP-binding site is
completely different from that of the P-loop.  Examples  of  such proteins are
the E1-E2 ATPases or  the  glycolytic kinases.   In  other ATP- or GTP-binding
proteins the flexible loop exists  in a  slightly different form; this is  the
case for tubulins or protein kinases.  A special mention must  be reserved for
adenylate  kinase,  in  which  there  is a  single  deviation  from the P-loop
pattern: in the last position Gly is found instead of Ser or Thr.

-Consensus pattern: [AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: a majority.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: in addition to the proteins  listed
 above,  the 'A' motif is also  found in a number  of other proteins.  Most of
 these proteins  probably  bind  a nucleotide, but others are definitively not
 ATP- or GTP-binding (as for example  chymotrypsin,  or  human  ferritin light
 chain).

* EF-hand calcium-binding domain signature and profile *
********************************************************

Many calcium-binding proteins belong to the same evolutionary family and share
a  type  of calcium-binding domain known as the EF-hand [1 to 5]. This type of
domain  consists  of  a  twelve  residue loop flanked on both side by a twelve
residue  alpha-helical domain (see <PDB:1CLL>). In an EF-hand loop the calcium
ion is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration. The six residues
involved  in the binding are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12; these residues
are denoted by X, Y, Z, -Y, -X and -Z. The invariant Glu or Asp at position 12
provides   two   oxygens  for  liganding  Ca  (bidentate  ligand).  The  basic
structural/functional  unit  of  EF-hand proteins is usually a pair of EF-hand
motifs  that  together  form a stable four-helix bundle domain. The pairing of
EF-hand enables cooperativity in the binding of Ca2+ ions.

We list below the proteins  which  are  known to contain EF-hand  regions. For
each type of protein we have indicated between parenthesis the total number of
EF-hand regions known or supposed to exist.   This  number  does  not  include
regions which  clearly  have  lost  their  calcium-binding  properties, or the
atypical low-affinity site (which spans thirteen residues) found in the S-100/
ICaBP family of proteins [6].

 - Aequorin and Renilla luciferin binding protein (LBP) (Ca=3).
 - Alpha actinin (Ca=2).
 - Calbindin (Ca=4).
 - Calcineurin B subunit (protein phosphatase 2B regulatory subunit) (Ca=4).

 - Diacylglycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.107) (DGK) (Ca=2).
 - FAD-dependent   glycerol-3-phosphate   dehydrogenase   (EC  1.1.99.5)  from
   mammals (Ca=1).
 - Fimbrin (plastin) (Ca=2).
 - Flagellar calcium-binding protein (1f8) from Trypanosoma cruzi (Ca=1 or 2).
 - Guanylate cyclase activating protein (GCAP) (Ca=3).
 - Inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C isozymes gamma-1 and delta-1
   (Ca=2) [10].
 - Intestinal calcium-binding protein (ICaBPs) (Ca=2).
 - MIF related proteins 8 (MRP-8 or CFAG) and 14 (MRP-14) (Ca=2).
 - Myosin regulatory light chains (Ca=1).
 - Oncomodulin (Ca=2).
 - Osteonectin  (basement  membrane  protein  BM-40) (SPARC) and proteins that
   contains an  'osteonectin'  domain  (QR1, matrix glycoprotein SC1) (see the
   entry <PDOC00535>) (Ca=1).
 - Parvalbumins alpha and beta (Ca=2).
 - Placental  calcium-binding  protein  (18a2)  (nerve  growth  factor induced
   protein 42a) (p9k) (Ca=2).
 - Recoverins (visinin, hippocalcin, neurocalcin, S-modulin) (Ca=2 to 3).
 - Reticulocalbin (Ca=4).
 - S-100 protein, alpha and beta chains (Ca=2).
 - Sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCPs) (Ca=2 to 3).
 - Sea urchin proteins Spec 1 (Ca=4), Spec 2 (Ca=4?), Lps-1 (Ca=8).
 - Serine/threonine  specific  protein  phosphatase  rdgc  (EC 3.1.3.16)  from
   Drosophila (Ca=2).
 - Sorcin V19 from hamster (Ca=2).
 - Spectrin alpha chain (Ca=2).
 - Squidulin (optic lobe calcium-binding protein) from squid (Ca=4).
 - Troponins C; from  skeletal muscle (Ca=4), from cardiac muscle (Ca=3), from
   arthropods and molluscs (Ca=2).

There has been a number of attempts [7,8] to develop patterns that pick-up EF-
hand  regions,  but  these  studies were made a few years ago when not so many
different  families  of  calcium-binding  proteins  were  known.  We therefore
developed a new pattern which takes into account all published sequences. This
pattern  includes the complete EF-hand loop as well as the first residue which
follows  the loop and which seem to always be hydrophobic. We also developed a
profile that covers the loop and the two alpha helices.

-Consensus pattern: D-{W}-[DNS]-{ILVFYW}-[DENSTG]-[DNQGHRK]-{GP}-[LIVMC]-
                    [DENQSTAGC]-x(2)-[DE]-[LIVMFYW]

-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
 probably not calcium-binding  and  a few proteins for which we have reason to
 believe that  they bind  calcium:  a number  of endoglucanases and a xylanase
 from the  cellulosome complex of Clostridium [9].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.

-Note: Positions 1 (X), 3 (Y) and 12 (-Z) are the most conserved.
-Note: The 6th residue in an EF-hand loop is, in most  cases a  Gly,  but  the
 number of exceptions to this 'rule' has gradually increased and we felt  that
 the pattern should include all the  different  residues which have been shown
 to exist in this position in functional Ca-binding sites.
-Note: The pattern will, in some cases,  miss  one  of  the EF-hand regions in
 some proteins with multiple EF-hand domains.

* Actinin-type actin-binding domain signatures *
************************************************

Alpha-actinin is  a F-actin cross-linking  protein  which is thought to anchor
actin to a variety of intracellular structures [1].   The actin-binding domain
of alpha-actinin seems to reside in the first  250 residues of the protein.  A
similar actin-binding domain has  been  found in the N-terminal region of many
different actin-binding proteins [2,3]:

 - In the beta chain of spectrin (or fodrin).
 - In dystrophin, the protein defective  in  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
   and which  may  play a  role  in  anchoring the  cytoskeleton to the plasma
   membrane.
 - In the slime mold gelation factor (or ABP-120).
 - In actin-binding protein ABP-280  (or filamin), a  protein  that link actin
   filaments to membrane glycoproteins.
 - In fimbrin (or plastin),  an actin-bundling protein.  Fimbrin  differs from
   the above proteins in  that  it  contains  two  tandem copies of the actin-
   binding domain and that these copies are located  in the C-terminal part of
   the protein.

We selected  two  conserved  regions  as  signature  patterns for this type of
domain.  The first of this region  is located at  the beginning of the domain,
while the second one is  located in  the central section and has been shown to
be essential for the binding of actin.

* Kringle domain signature and profile *
****************************************

Kringles [1,2,3]  are triple-looped, disulfide cross-linked domains found in a
varying number  of  copies,  in some serine proteases and plasma proteins. The
kringle domain has been found in the following proteins:

 - Apolipoprotein A (38 copies).
 - Blood coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) (1 copy).
 - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (4 copies).
 - Hepatocyte growth factor like protein (4 copies) [4].
 - Hepatocyte growth factor activator [1] (once) [5].
 - Plasminogen (5 copies).
 - Thrombin (2 copies).
 - Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) (2 copies).
 - Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (1 copy).

The schematic  representation  of the structure of a typical kringle domain is
shown below:

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

Kringle domains  are thought to  play a  role  in  binding  mediators, such as
membranes, other   proteins   or  phospholipids,  and  in  the  regulation  of
proteolytic activity.   As a  signature pattern  for this type  of domain,  we
selected a  conserved  sequence that contains two of the cysteines invovled in
disulfide bonds.

******************************************
* EGF-like domain signatures and profile *
******************************************

A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
proliferation.

A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
two-stranded sheet   (see   <PDB:1EGF>).   Subdomains  between  the  conserved
cysteines strongly  vary  in  length  as  shown  in  the  following  schematic
representation of the EGF-like domain:

                 +-------------------+        +-------------------------+
                 |                   |        |                         |

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'G': often conserved glycine
'a': often conserved aromatic amino acid
'*': position of both patterns.
'x': any residue
